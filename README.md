# Pixeltrack
============

Web analytics plays a critical part in the services of many service providers
on the Internet today. Clients often want to see statistics about the number
of users that visit particular pages.

## Use Case Example

Consider the case where a merchandiser is not completing the number of sales
that it expects. The typical process of completing a sale is:

1. Searches website for item
2. Selects item and goes to item page
3. Add item to cart
4. Initiate checkout process
5. Enter shipping and payment information
6. Complete transaction

Customers may abort the purchase of an item for any number of reasons at any one
of these steps. The utility of page view metrics comes from being able to see
at which step the drop off in the number occurs, which may indicate the presence
of bugs or unintuitive UI.

Pixeltrack serves as a way to report these metrics and points clients in the
direction of which processes they need to examine for bugs, UI choices or other
issues.
